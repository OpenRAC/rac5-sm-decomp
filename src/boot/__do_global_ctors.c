/* __do_global_ctors: from the L__main module of GCC's libgcc2.c,
 * public GCC revision 31cf01446d (1999-09-09), the libgcc source OpenRAC/rac1-decomp
 * and OpenRAC/rac2-decomp rebuild. Below is the upstream text in file order, unchanged:
 * libgcc2.c lines 1-27, 2820-2822, 2824-2837, 2869-2895 and 2919-2920. The notice of
 * gbl-ctors.h (lines 1-23) follows libgcc2.c's, and gbl-ctors.h lines 25-91 stand in
 * place of line 2823's #include. Added: the module selector the libgcc build passes.
 * GPL-2.0-or-later with the libgcc linking exception below; see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
 * No SDK source is used.
