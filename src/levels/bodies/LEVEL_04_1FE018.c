/* LEVEL_04:0x1FE018 -- 164-byte body, 2 placements.
 *
 * What it does: turns three 0x20-fixed-point differences into floats scaled by
 * 2^-31, splits the word at 0x14 into its low 24 bits (stored at 0x2C) and its
 * top byte, and writes that top byte back as a float at 0x30.
 *
 * Where the form comes from:
 *   - the top byte is an *unsigned int*, so the pinned chain emits the retail's
 *     sign-test fixup (bltz + (v>>1|(v&1))*2) even though the value is 0..255;
 *   - the three scaled differences keep the retail's store order 0x24, 0x28,
 *     0x34 around the conversion.
 *
 * Proof: *** EXACT *** at LEVEL_04.REL:0x1FE018, profile pinned.
